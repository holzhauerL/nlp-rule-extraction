A common misconception is that Light Roasts don’t have as much caffeine as their darker, bolder counterparts. However, the truth is exactly the opposite! As beans roast, the caffeine slowly cooks out of the bean. Therefore, because lightly roasted beans cook for a shorter time and at a lower temperature, they retain more caffeine from the original green coffee bean. Other roasters refer to a Light Roast as Light City Roast, New England Roast, or Cinnamon Roast.\n",

They are balanced, exhibiting significant flavor and aroma. Medium Roast coffees are brown and have a little thicker body than a Light Roast. Unlike Light, Medium starts to take on a bit of the taste from the roasting process, losing some of the bright floral flavors that are typical of a Light Roast. Instead, they carry much more of a balanced flavor with a medium amount of caffeine. A Medium is roasted until just before the second crack.\n",

      "\t\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\t-> Dark Roast:\n",
      "\tDark roasts are dark brown to almost black, coffee beans roasted until they exude oils and therefore have an oil sheen glowing on the surface. The roasting process’s flavor overwhelms the beans’ flavor, and the coffee from some beans may taste spicy, bitter or smoky.\tTo be considered Dark, beans roast to a temperature of anything higher than 440° or essentially to the end of the second crack. If beans roast much hotter than 780°, the coffee will start to taste more and more of charcoal and will not pass the final quality check. This roasting degree is the only one that requires the use of roasting oven 5. If the coffee pile on the tray reaches 175mm and beyond, then the roasting oven 5 should not have its temperatures exceed 580°. Similarly, for coffee piles smaller than 175mm, roasting oven 5 should not go beyond 560°.\n",
      "\tMany other big-batch roasters cut corners by roasting larger quantities faster at extremely high temperatures for a short amount of time but it is important for us to still respect a new pattern of roasting beginning at oven chamber 1, if the coffee pile is at least 175mm high then roasting oven 1 should not exceed 580° and the lowest temperature allowed would be 220°, similarly for roasting oven 2 the temperatures reach at most 680° and go no lower than 320°. Continuing the process, if roasting oven 3 goes above 780° or if roasting oven 4 exceeds 680°, the final product will be rejected! The same outcome will happen if roasting oven 3 fails to maintain at least 421° or if roasting oven 4 goes lower than 320°.\n",
      "\tHowever, for piles of other heights, roasting oven 1 should remain between 200° and 560° including both temperatures. These piles of other sizes can also accept temperatures of at least 300° and up to 660° for roasting chamber 2, however, if they surpass 760° or if the temperature drops below 400° at roasting oven 3, then the final product will undoubtedly be rejected. Finally, please respect that in order to achieve the first crack in the coffee beans, oven chamber 4 should go as high as 680° but not drop below 320°.\n",

      " In general, we first distinguish between three roasting degrees: light, medium and dark. Secondly, we have acknowledge the coffee pile height in the tray as that play a big role in the temperature of the roasting ovens which are the third and last constraint that needs to be abided to.  For better understanding, we describe temperature rules with boundary temperatures t_min and t_max and distinguish between:    open brackets, e.g., (t_min, t_max), this means that the boundary temperatures ARE NOT included in the rules.    closed brackets, e.g., [t_min, t_max], this means that the boundary temperatures ARE included in the rules.     Light Roast:  Goes through roasting oven 1,2 and 3.  Light roasts are light brown with no oil on the bean surface, with a toasted grain taste and noticeable acidity. A common misconception is that Light Roasts don’t have as much caffeine as their darker, bolder counterparts. However, the truth is exactly the opposite! As beans roast, the caffeine slowly cooks out of the bean. Therefore, because lightly roasted beans cook for a shorter time and at a lower temperature, they retain more caffeine from the original green coffee bean. Other roasters refer to a Light Roast as Light City Roast, New England Roast, or Cinnamon Roast.    We first distinguish between a tray height of less than 180mm and higher or equal to 180mm:       Coffee tray height lower than 180mm:    We inherently can not allow a temperature of roasting oven 1 to go below 120° or above 400°. Roasting oven 2 should maintain its temperature as [220°, 500°]. The final product will present a good quality if the highest temperatures of roasting oven 3 remain at 550°.         Coffee tray height of at least 180mm:    Roasting oven 1 should follow temperature rule [140°, 420°]. Afterwards, it is not allowed for roasting oven 2 to go above 520° or below 240°. Finally, the product will not pass the quality standard if roasting oven 3 fails to maintain its temperatures below 571°.        Medium Roast:  Goes through roasting oven 1,2,3 and 4.  Medium roasts are medium brown to brown with no oil on the surface, although darker roasts in this group may appear slightly shiny. They are balanced, exhibiting significant flavor and aroma. Medium Roast coffees are brown and have a little thicker body than a Light Roast. Unlike Light, Medium starts to take on a bit of the taste from the roasting process, losing some of the bright floral flavors that are typical of a Light Roast. Instead, they carry much more of a balanced flavor with a medium amount of caffeine. A Medium is roasted until just before the second crack.  For a successful medium roast of coffee beans the following technical requirements should be followed:       Coffee tray height of at most 170mm:    Temperatures of roasting 1 should follow [170°,450°].    Temperatures of roasting 2 should follow [270°,550°].    Temperatures of roasting 3 should follow [370°,650°].    Temperatures of roasting 4 should not exceed 550°.         Coffee tray height of at least 170mm:    Temperatures of roasting 1 should avoid (0°,180°) and (460°,1000°).    Temperatures of roasting 2 should avoid (0°,290°) and (570°,1000°).    Temperatures of roasting 3 should avoid (0°,390°) and (670°,1000°).    Temperatures of roasting 4 should reach at most 560°.        Dark Roast:  Dark roasts are dark brown to almost black, coffee beans roasted until they exude oils and therefore have an oil sheen glowing on the surface. The roasting process’s flavor overwhelms the beans’ flavor, and the coffee from some beans may taste spicy, bitter or smoky. To be considered Dark, beans roast to a temperature of anything higher than 440° or essentially to the end of the second crack. If beans roast much hotter than 780°, the coffee will start to taste more and more of charcoal and will not pass the final quality check. This roasting degree is the only one that requires the use of roasting oven 5. If the coffee pile on the tray reaches 175mm and beyond, then the roasting oven 5 should not have its temperatures exceed 580°. Similarly, for coffee piles smaller than 175mm, roasting oven 5 should not go beyond 560°.  Many other big-batch roasters cut corners by roasting larger quantities faster at extremely high temperatures for a short amount of time but it is important for us to still respect a new pattern of roasting beginning at oven chamber 1, if the coffee pile is at least 175mm high then roasting oven 1 should not exceed 580° and the lowest temperature allowed would be 220°, similarly for roasting oven 2 the temperatures reach at most 680° and go no lower than 320°. Continuing the process, if roasting oven 3 goes above 780° or if roasting oven 4 exceeds 680°, the final product will be rejected! The same outcome will happen if roasting oven 3 fails to maintain at least 421° or if roasting oven 4 goes lower than 320°.  However, for piles of other heights, roasting oven 1 should remain between 200° and 560° including both temperatures. These piles of other sizes can also accept temperatures of at least 300° and up to 660° for roasting chamber 2, however, if they surpass 760° or if the temperature drops below 400° at roasting oven 3, then the final product will undoubtedly be rejected. Finally, please respect that in order to achieve the first crack in the coffee beans, oven chamber 4 should go as high as 680° but not drop below 320°.  \n"
