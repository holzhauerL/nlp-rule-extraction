       "   Increasing Capacity by painting the drum\\nSome Quest owners–to increase the maximum batch capacity or alter the roast environment’s thermal dynamics–paint the roasting drum’s exterior with high-heat matte black spray paint. Doing so causes the drum to efficiently absorb and conduct more infrared heat to the roast chamber independent of airflow speed (convection). Increasing the drum’s ability to absorb infrared heat increases the batch capacity, and heat changes are faster, even for large batch sizes (EG. <10 minutes, 300g roasts on an 400° M3).\\n\\n## Coffee Bean Cooling\\nThe supplied rectangular bean collector placed in the chaff collector cools the beans. This works but has several drawbacks. First, it is slow. Second, there is no air circulation through the roasting chamber with the bean collector inserted into the chaff collector. Use an external cooler instead, such as the optional one from the manufacturer or make one. Make a small box with a muffin fan in it and set the bean collector on top. The flow of ambient air through the beans is much more efficient than the Quests’ inbuilt cooling function.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\\n",
