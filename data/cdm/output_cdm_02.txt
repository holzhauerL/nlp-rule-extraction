<!-- Dataset Variables Explanation:

	-> project_activity: type of project activities
			- ENUM:
				afforestation
				reforestation
				other

	-> project_scope: scope of the A / R project
			- Binary value: 1 = large_scale and 0 = small_scale

	-> land_project_activity: type of land subject to project activity
			- Binary value: 1 = wetland and 0 = other_land 

	-> containing_organic_soils: determines if the land contains organic soils
			- Boolean: True or False

	-> land_subject_to_land_use_and_management: determines if land is subject to land-use and management practices
			- Boolean: True or False
	
	-> receives_listed_inputs: determines if land which is subject to land-use and management practices recieves (relevant) input of different kinds
			- Boolean: True or False

	-> soil_disturbance_area: percentage of area covered by soil disturbance attributable to the project activity
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)

	-> comply_with_contained_tools: compliance of tools used within the methodology
			- Boolean: True or False
