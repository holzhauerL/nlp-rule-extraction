<!-- Dataset Variables Explanation:

	-> project_scope: scope of the A / R project
			- Binary value: 1 = large_scale and 0 = small_scale

	-> activity_type: type of project activities
			- Binary value: 1 = ar_activitiy and 0 = other_activity

	-> land_type: type of land subject to project activity
			- Binary value: 1 = wetland and 0 = other_land 

	-> soil_organicity: determines if soil is organic
			- Binary value: 1 = organic and 0 = not_organic 

	-> lu_mm_practices_subj_input: determines if land is subject to land-use and management practices and recieves (relevant) input of different kinds
			- Binary value: 1 = subject_and_input and 0 = not_subject_no_input 

	-> area_percentage: percentage of area covered by soil disturbance attributable to the project activity
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)

	-> contained_tools_compliance: compliance of tools used within the methodology
			- Binary value: 1 = compliant and 0 = non_compliant
