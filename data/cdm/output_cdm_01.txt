<!-- Dataset Variables Explanation:

	-> activity_type: type of project activities
			- Binary value: 1 = ar_activitiy and 0 = other_activity 

	-> habitat_type: wetland / habitat classification
			- Binary value: 1 = degraded_mangrove_habitat and 0 = other_habitat

	-> magrove_species: percentage of species categorisable as mangroves
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)

	-> area_percentage: percentage of area covered by soil disturbance attributable to the project activity mechanism (CDM)
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)

	-> contained_tools_compliance: compliance of tools used within the methodology
			- Binary value: 1 = compliant and 0 = non_compliant
