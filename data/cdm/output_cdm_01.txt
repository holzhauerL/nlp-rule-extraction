<!-- Dataset Variables Explanation:

	-> project_activity: type of project activities
			- ENUM:
				afforestation
				reforestation
				other

	-> land_project_activity: wetland / habitat classification
			- Binary value: 1 = degraded_mangrove_habitat and 0 = other_habitat

	-> project_area_with_mangrove: percentage of project area planted with mangrove species
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)

	-> soil_disturbance_area: percentage of area covered by soil disturbance attributable to the project activity mechanism (CDM)
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)

	-> comply_with_contained_tools: compliance of tools used within the methodology
			- Boolean: True or False
