# Scope

This methodology applies to afforestation and reforestation (A/R) project activities implemented in degraded mangrove habitats. 

# Applicability

This methodology is applicable under the following conditions:

(a) The land subject to the project activity is degraded mangrove habitat;

(b) More than 90 per cent of the project area is planted with mangrove species. If more than 10 per cent of the project area is planted with non-mangrove species then the project activity does not lead to alteration of hydrology of the project area and hydrology of connected up-gradient and down-gradient wetland area;

(c) Soil disturbance attributable to the A/R clean development mechanism (CDM) project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of area.

A project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability conditions of the tools contained within the methodology and applied by the project activity.

# Entry into force

The date of entry into force of the revision is the date of the publication of the EB 75 meeting report on 4 October 2013.
