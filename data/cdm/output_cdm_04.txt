<!-- Dataset Variables Explanation:

	-> building_type: type of building that is the subject of the project
			- Binary value: 1 = commercial_building and 0 = other

	-> project_nature: nature of construction operation
			- ENUM: 
			 	retrofit
				new_construction
				other

	-> project_type: specific type of construction / retrofit project
			- ENUM:
				ee_building_design_features
				ee_appliances_equip_tech
				e_mm_controls
				os_renewable_e_projects
				os_cogeneration
				fossil_fuel_switching

	-> technologies_used: types of technologies used as part of the project
			- Binary value: 1 = new and 0 = transferred

	-> activity_affects: entities that project activities can influence
			- ENUM:
				os_district_heating_plant
				os_district_cooling_plant
				distribution_networks

	-> refrigerant: refrigerator contained in the energy efficient equipment
			- Binary value: 1 = contained and 0 =  not_contained

	-> refrigerant_type: determines if refrigerator contains ozone depleting potential (ODP)
			- Binary value: 1 = odp and 0 = no_odp

	-> activity_type: determines if project contains fuel switch related activities
			- Binary value: 1 = fuel_switch and 0 = no_fuel_switch

	-> emission_reductions: determines if project equipment, systems or actions (used to claim emission reductions) are unique / only counted once
			- Binary value: 1 = unique and 0 = not_unique

	-> project_design_document: determines if project design document exists
			- Binary value: 1 = existent and 0 = non_existent

	-> electricity_savings: annual amount of electricity savings in GWh by a single project
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)
