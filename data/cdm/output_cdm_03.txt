<!-- Dataset Variables Explanation:

	-> category: project activity to reduce emissions
			- Binary value: 1 = cable_car_substituting_road_based_transport and 0 = other

	-> relevancy_for_trip: is cable car part of a / a total trip of a passenger
			- ENUM: 
				part_of_trip
				total_trip
				other

	-> extension: determines if project is an extension of an existing cable car
			- Boolean: True or False

	-> cable_car_accessibility: accessibility of origin and final destination of cable car
			- Binary value: 1 = accessible_by_road and 0 = not_accessible_by_road
	
	-> bio_fuel_blends_used: determines if bio fuel blends are used as liquid fuels
			- Boolean: True or False
	
	-> specific_fuel_consumption_value_adjusted: determines if the specific fuel consumption value and the emission factors used are adjusted
			- Boolean: True or False

	-> compliance_of_fuels: compliant if fuels used are electricity, gaseous or liquid fossil fuels (incl. bio fuels)
			- Binary value: 1 = compliant and 0 = not_compliant

	-> emission_reductions_annually: annual amount of emission reductions in kt CO2e
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)
