<!-- Dataset Variables Explanation:

	-> project_context: context of cable car construction. Substitution of traditional road-based transport trips or other context
			- Binary value: 1 = substitution and 0 = other

	-> relevancy_for_trip: is cable car part of a / a total trip of a passenger
			- ENUM: 
				part_of_trip
				total_trip
				other

	-> project_type: is project an extension of an existing cable car
			-Binary value: 1 = extension and 0 = no_extension

	-> cable_car_accessibility: accessibility of origin and final destination of cable car
			- Binary value: 1 = accessible_by_road and 0 = not_accessible_by_road

	-> compliance_of_fuels: compliant if fuels used are electricity, gaseous or liquid fossil fuels (incl. bio fuels)
			- Binary value: 1 = compliant and 0 = not_compliant

	-> annual_emission_reductions: annual amount of emission reductions in kt CO2e
			- Float value (rounded to two decimals)
