# Scope

This category comprises renewable electricity generation units, such as solar photovoltaic, hydro, wind and renewable biomass that supply electricity to individual households/users or groups of households/users.

# Applicability

To validate the applicability of its project activity, an organisation needs to follow a specific evaluation procedure. If it fails in one of the steps, the evaluation procedure terminates with the result of non-applicability and this methodology shall not be applied. 

First, it shall be evaluated if the project involves a new installation or if the project is replacing an existing onsite fossil-fuel-fired generation. If one of these conditions holds true, the next step is to check if a grid connection is present or will be present at any time during the crediting period. If any of the units to be supplied with electricity will be newly connected to the grid at any time during the crediting period, the evaluation procedure terminates with the result of non-applicability. 
If the project is not limited to supplying individual households with stand-alone electricity systems but also involves households which have a grid connection prior to the project activity, it needs to be evaluated if one of the following three exceptions holds true. 

(1) The sum of installed capacities of all renewable energy units connected to the grid supplying the households is less than 15 MW. 
(2) The project involves renewable energy-based lighting applications and the emission reductions per system are less than 5 tonnes of CO2e a year and there is a demonstration with either a representative sample survey of target households or official statistics from the host country government agencies that fossil fuels would have been used in the absence of the project activity.
(3) The electricity from the grid supplying the group of households prior to the start date of the project activity is available for less than 36 hours in any given calendar month or the grid connected household coverage in the host country is less than 50%. 

If of of the three exceptions is violated, the evaluation procedure terminates with the result of non-applicability. If one of the three exceptions holds true in the grid-connected case or the project is limited to supplying individual households with stand-alone electricity systems, the next step in the evaluation procedure is to check whether the supplying electricity is generated by a hydro power plant. If it is generated by a hydro power plant, the next evaluation step is to check if at one of the following three conditions are satisified. 

(1) The project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir with no change in the volume of reservoir.
(2) The project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir, where the volume of reservoir is increased and the power densitiy of the project activity is greater than 4 W/m^2.
(3) The project activity results in new reservoirs and the power density of the power plant is greater than 4 W/m^2. 

If at least one of the three conditions for a hydro power plant is violated, the evaluation procedure terminates with the result of non-applciability. If at least one of the three conditions for a hydro power plant is satisfied or the electricity is not generated by a hydro power plant, the next step in the evaluation procedure is to check if the project involves a combined heat and power cogeneration system. If this is the case, the evaluation process terminates with the result of non-applicability. If it is not a combined heat and power cogeneration system, the following evaluation step is to check if the electricity generation unit added involves both renewable and non-renewable components. If it does involve both renewable and non-renewable components, the capacitiy of the renewable components shall be less than 15 MW. If it does exceed this limit, the evaluation procedure terminates with the result of non-applicability.

If the condition on the renewable components of not exceeding 15 MW is satisfied, the next check is if the project activity involves retrofit or replacement of an existing renewable electricity generation unit. If it does involve retrofit or replacement, the final output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall be less than the limit of 15 MW. If it does exceed this limit, the evaluation procedure terminates with the result of non-applicability. 

If the project does not involve a retrofit or replacement of an exisitng renewable electricity generation unit or does involve a retrofit or replacement with a final output less than 15 MW, the next evaluation step is to check if the project activity involves the addition of renewable electricity generation units to an exisiting renewable electricity generation facitility. If this is not the case, the evaluation procedure terminates with the result of applciability. If the project activity involves the addition of renewable electricity generation units to an existing renewable electricity generation facility, the total capacity of the units added by the project shall be lower than 15 MW and shall be physically distinct from the existing units. If this is the case, the evaluation procedure terminates with the result of applicability. Otherwise, it terminates with the result of non-applicability. 

# Entry into force

The date of entry into force is the date of the publication of the EB  115 meeting report on 8 September 2022.
