Introduction

The following table describes the key elements of the methodology:

Table 1.	Methodology key elements

Typical project(s)

Renewable electricity generation by individual households/users or groups of households/users

Type of GHG emissions mitigation action

Renewable energy:

Displacement of more-GHG-intensive, non-renewable electricity applications by introducing renewable energy technologies

Scope, applicability, and entry into force

Scope

This category comprises renewable electricity generation units, such as solar photovoltaic, hydro, wind and renewable biomass that supply electricity to individual households/users or groups of households/users.

Applicability

The methodology is applicable to project activities that involve new installations (greenfield) or replace existing onsite fossil-fuel-fired generation.

The applicability of the methodology is limited to individual households and users that do not have a grid connection except when:

A group of households or users are supplied with electricity through a standalone mini-grid powered by renewable energy generation unit(s) where the capacity of the generating units does not exceed 15 MW (i.e. the sum of installed capacities of all renewable energy units connected to the mini-grid is less than 15 MW), e.g. a community-based stand-alone off-the-grid renewable electricity systems; or

For renewable energy-based lighting applications, the emission reductions per system is less than 5 tonnes of CO2e a year and it shall be demonstrated that that fossil fuels would have been used in the absence of the project activity by:

A representative sample survey of target households; or

Official statistics from the host country government agencies;

A group of households or users are connected to a grid prior to the start date of the project activity (or the start date of validation with due justification), however the electricity from the grid is available for the households and users for less than 36 hours in any given calendar month during the crediting period or the grid connected household coverage in the host country is less than 50%.

The methodology is not applicable to project activities that include units that will be connected to the grid at any time during the crediting period.

Hydro power plants with reservoirs that satisfy at least one of the following conditions are eligible to apply this methodology:

The project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir with no change in the volume of reservoir;

The project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir, where the volume of reservoir is increased and the power density of the project activity is greater than 4 W/m2;

The project activity results in new reservoirs and the power density of the power plant, is greater than 4 W/m2.

Combined heat and power (cogeneration) systems are not eligible under this category.

If the electricity generation unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15 MW for a small-scale CDM project activity applies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the capacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW.

Project activities that involve retrofit or replacement of an existing renewable electricity generation unit are included in this category. To qualify as a small-scale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW.

In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable electricity generation units to an existing renewable electricity generation facility, the total capacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct from the existing units.

In the case the project activities utilize biomass, the “TOOL16: Project and leakage emissions from biomass” shall be applied to determine the relevant project emissions from the cultivation of biomass and the utilization of biomass or biomass residues.

Entry into force

The date of entry into force is the date of the publication of the EB  115 meeting report on 8 September 2022.

Applicability of sectoral scopes

For validation and verification of CDM projects and programme of activities by a designated operational entity (DOE) using this methodology, application of sectoral scope 01 is mandatory and application of sectoral scope 13 and 15 is conditional.

Normative references

Project participants shall apply the General guidelines for SSC CDM methodologies and TOOL21: Demonstration of additionality of small-scale project activities

This methodology also refers to the latest approved versions of the following approved methodologies, tools and standard:

Definitions

The definitions contained in the Glossary of CDM terms shall apply.

In addition, the following definitions apply:

Capacity addition - increase of the installed power generation capacity of existing power plants through: (i) the installation of new power plants/units in parallel to the existing power plants/units; or (ii) the installation of new power plants/units, additional to the existing power plants/units. The existing power plants/units in the case of capacity addition continue to operate after the implementation of the project activity;

Co-fired system - an installation that uses both fossil fuels and renewable fuels in a single boiler for simultaneous combustion; fossil fuel may be used during a period of time when the biomass is not available;

Existing reservoir - a reservoir is to be considered as an “existing reservoir” if it has been in operation for at least three years before the implementation of the project activity;

Greenfield power plant - a new renewable energy power plant that is constructed and operated at a site where no renewable energy power plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activity;

Mini-grid - a small-scale power system with a total capacity not exceeding 15 MW (i.e. the sum of installed capacities of all generators connected to the mini-grid is equal to or less than 15 MW) which is not connected to a national or a regional grid.

Baseline methodology

Project boundary

The spatial extent of the project boundary includes the physical, geographical site of the renewable electricity generating unit(s) and the equipment that uses the electricity produced.

Baseline

The baseline emissions are calculated based on the fuel consumption of the technology in use or that would have been used to generate the equivalent quantity of energy in the absence of the project activity, using one of the following three options:

Option 1: based on the electricity consumption of the households/user

Baseline emissions are calculated as follows:





Where:



=

Baseline emissions in year y (t CO2)



=

Energy baseline in year y (kWh)



=

Emission factor (t CO2/kWh)

The energy baseline is the total annual electricity consumption of the households/users c that are supplied with electricity generated by units i:





Where:



=

Energy baseline in year y (kWh)

c

=

Type of consumer (e.g. households, rural health centres, rural schools, grain milling, water pumping, irrigation, etc.) covered by the project activity

i

=

Type of renewable electricity generation unit(s) implemented by the project activity



=

Number of consumers type c supplied with renewable electricity generation unit(s) type i



=

Electricity consumption by user type c supplied with unit type i in year y (kWh)



=

Average technical transmission and distribution losses that would have been observed in diesel powered mini-grids installed by public programmes or distribution companies in isolated areas, expressed as a fraction

Option 2: based on the annual electricity generation by the project activity

Baseline emissions are calculated as follows:





The energy baseline is the total annual electricity generated by the project activity unit(s):





Where:



=

Energy baseline in year y (kWh)

i

=

Renewable energy electricity generation technologies units type i implemented as part of by the project activity



=

Electricity generation by the project activity unit(s) type i in year y (kWh)



=

Average technical transmission and distribution losses that would have been observed in diesel powered mini-grids installed by public programmes or distribution companies in isolated areas, expressed as a fraction

Option 3: based on a trend-adjusted projection of historical fuel consumption

In the case of replacement of existing fossil fuel based technologies, the baseline emissions in year y are calculated based on a trend-adjusted projection of historical fuel consumption as follows:





Where:



=

Baseline emissions in year y (t CO2)



=

Projected fuel consumption of fuel type j in year y (mass or volume unit)



=

Net calorific value of fuel type j (GJ per mass or volume unit)



=

CO2 emission factor of fuel type j (t CO2/GJ)



=

Fuel type used for combustion

In the specific case of lighting devices, a daily usage of 3.5 hours per day shall be assumed for the projection of the fuel consumption. Project participants shall justify the use of different usage hours based on representative sampling, conducted in accordance with the “Standard: Sampling and surveys for CDM project activities and programme of activities.”

The baseline emissions of project activities that involve retrofit/replacement of an existing facility or capacity addition at an existing facility, shall be calculated following the procedures prescribed in AMS-I.D. with the exception that the applicable emission factor (EFCO2) is calculated as described in this methodology.

For project activities that introduce renewable-based electricity to communities, baseline emissions can also be determined using the provisions of AMS-I.L., provided that the relevant applicability and monitoring requirements of AMS-I.L. are also met.

Project emissions

For most renewable energy project activities, PEy = 0. However, for the following categories of project activities, project emissions have to be considered following the procedure described in the ACM0002.

Emissions related to the operation of geothermal power plants (e.g. non-condensable gases, electricity/fossil fuel consumption);

Emissions from water reservoirs of hydro power plants.

For project activities that utilize biomass and/or biomass residues, the TOOL16 shall be applied to determine the following project emission sources, including the simplifications for small-scale and microscale project activities:

Project emissions resulting from the cultivation of biomass in a dedicated plantation of a CDM project activity that uses biomass (PEBC);

Project emissions resulting from the transportation of biomass (PEBT);

Project emissions resulting from the processing of biomass (PEBP);

Project emissions resulting from the transportation of biomass residues (PEBRT), if the project consumes biomass residues;

Project emissions resulting from the processing of biomass residues (PEBRP), if the project consumes biomass residues.

Leakage

If the energy generating equipment is transferred from another activity, leakage is to be considered.

For project activities utilizing biomass and/or biomass residues, the TOOL16 shall be applied to determine the leakage. Project participants shall indicate in the PDD which leakage sources are included. If emission sources are not considered, the project participants shall provide proper justification in the PDD.

Monitoring methodology

For project activities that determine baseline emissions based on section 5.2.3 (Option 3), above the corresponding monitoring procedures prescribed in AMS-I.L. shall apply.

For project activities that determine baseline emissions based on the other options provided by the methodology, the relevant parameters shall be monitored as indicated in the tables below.
