<!-- Dataset Variables Explanation:

	-> nature_of_prod_or_serv: determines if products or services (contained in the application) can be classified as an invention
			- Binary value: 1 = invention and 0 = no_invention

	-> authority_type: determines authority type
			- Binary value: 1 = german_patent_and_trade_mark_office and 0 = other

	-> application_name: determines if name is contained in application
			- Binary value: 1 = contained and 0 = not_contained

	-> application_request_for_grant: determines if request for grant is contained in application
			- Binary value: 1 = contained and 0 = not_contained

	-> application_patent_claim: determines if patent claim is contained in application
			- Binary value: 1 = contained and 0 = not_contained

	-> application_description: determines if description is contained in application
			- Binary value: 1 = contained and 0 = not_contained

	-> application_drawings: determines if drawings are contained in application
			- Binary value: 1 = contained and 0 = not_contained

	-> application_clarity: clarity of the content / information contained in the application
			- Binary value: 1 = clear and 0 = unclear

	-> number_of_inventions: number of inventions contained in application
			- Integer value

	-> content_relationship: determines if inventions contained in the same application belong together
			- Binary value: 1 = together and 0 = seperate
