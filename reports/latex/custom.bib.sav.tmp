  abstract = {Carbon taxes are considered a key instrument for achieving deep decarbonization but are often unpopular among voters. While existing studies indicate that public opposition to carbon taxes is influenced by climate change belief and by political trust, less is known about the relevance of other factors. Moreover, it remains unclear why people oppose carbon taxes more fiercely than other climate policies. To enhance understanding of carbon tax opposition, I synthesize and categorize 28 conditions that potentially provoke public opposition to carbon taxes, assess their independent importance for predicting carbon tax opposition, and review the specific form in which they predict carbon tax opposition. This analysis draws on data from approximately 44,400 individuals from 23 European countries. It uses a random forest model, a machine learning method, to estimate independent prediction effects. The results identify the feeling of personal responsibility for trying to reduce climate change as the most important condition for predicting opposition to carbon taxes and for predicting attitudes on other climate policies. Political trust, in contrast, strongly predicts carbon tax opposition but not attitudes on other climate policies, suggesting that low political trust could explain the peculiar public aversion against carbon taxes. Recycling revenues from existing carbon prices back to households, often considered crucial for securing public support, is only associated with minor increases in the acceptance of higher carbon taxes. Finally, the results reveal that age, market liberal values, and good governance are related to carbon tax opposition in a non-monotonous pattern.},

  abstract = {Social services intend to aid disadvantaged, distressed, or vulnerable persons or groups. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), which are important technologies to leverage Internet of Things and Big Data, have not been considered to support intelligent social services in Smart Cities. Using technology to achieve more responsive, efficient, and proactive social services is a must in Smart Cities because it will lead to a more fair and egalitarian society. This research work contributes with the evaluation of a thousand Neural Networks architectures for the automatic diagnosis of chronic social exclusion. Some of them outperform previous models in quality metrics such as accuracy and F-score. Beyond the improvement in predicting this specific social condition, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper open the research line of applying these methods for the general social services diagnosis in Smart Cities. Finally, the advantages of using the DL paradigm over other ML alternatives in this scope are discussed.},

  abstract = {The fight against social exclusion is at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy: 120 million people are at risk of suffering this condition in the EU. Risk prediction models are widely used in insurance companies and health services. However, the use of these models to allow an early detection of social exclusion by social workers is not a common practice. This paper describes a data analysis of over 16 K cases with over 60 predictors from the Spanish region of Castilla y León. The use of machine learning paradigms such as logistic regression and random forest makes possible a high precision in predicting chronic s
